  <h1 id="openmeet-space">OpenMeet Space</h1>
<p>A public documentation of initiation consisting of the plans and progress of OpenMeetSpace.</p>
<p>This document has the rough ideas and plans put forth to make OpenMeetSpace a reality. The final expected outcome being an &quot;open&quot; network of people in various industries with zero hierarchies with the opportunity to collaborate with each other. </p>
<h1 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h1>
<p>Everything OpenMeetSpace do will be &quot;open-source&quot; -- ideas, plans, and the tech used. This is an initiative to make collaborations and networking easy via meetups and online communities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How is it different from XYZ?</strong></p>
<p>This is mainly an open web platform to help communities organize meetups, find supporting venues, find target audience, and collaborate mainly revolving around small meetups.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="outline">Outline</h1>
<p>OpenMeet.space is going to be an open platform with three main categories:</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="1-meetups">1. Meetups</h3>
<p>This project was born from our love of meetups and so this is one of our main goals!</p>
<h4 id="the-problem">The Problem</h4>
<p>Organizing local meetups are <strong>time consuming</strong> and the <strong>work is concentrated</strong> on a few. Organizing subsequent meetups demand almost exactly the same energy as the previous meetups, or sometimes more depending on the reach and participants. This is coming from first hand experience. Our goal here is to simplify and automate this process into a flexible, and open source framework that anyone could easily follow.</p>
<h4 id="proposal">Proposal:</h4>
<p>Some suggestions regarding this idea</p>
<ul>
<li>Meetup Proposal via PRs: To propose an event, let's use something like a GitHub PR with all the details</li>
<li>Automating Registrations: using event platforms like EventBrite or something more &quot;open&quot; and automating the process</li>
<li>Event Catalog: All events, past and future could be catalogued</li>
<li>Event Notifications: People can subscribe to events from communities of their liking and get notifications via Email, Telegram, Whatsapp</li>
<li>Event Recording: Events should be ideally recorded and uploaded somewhere. We could think about crowdsourcing and provisioning recording equipments</li>
<li>Event Marketing: Channels like twitter, community posts and so can be leveraged to publcise events and some of these can even be automated</li>
</ul>
<p>This will be a platform to host and see upcoming meetups and OpenMeet.space will provide connections to venues and the network to reach the intended community.</p>
<h4 id="key-features">Key Features</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Organize</strong> - Everyone can host meetups and reach their targeted audience.</li>
<li><strong>Venue</strong> - We will be aggregating venues that are ready to host and support these events.</li>
<li><strong>SwagShop</strong> - For the events support or as goodies, you can distribute and manage swags (t-shirts, stickers, etc.) for the said meetup.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-people">2. People</h3>
<p>A catalog of people with their interests and a way to contact them. This is for the purpose of networking, it's just going to be a social link tree setup and nothing else.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The people who'll be in the catalog will only be added with their personal consent.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="3-foss-shop">3. FOSS Shop</h3>
<p>A place to list open source artifacts made by open source enthusiasts using open source tools. People can buy swag/merch from here and proceeds can go to them, after deducting production and shipping costs.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="tech">Tech</h3>
<p>The platform is going to be a website hosted on <a href="OpenMeet.space">OpenMeet.space</a>, the tech behind it will be completely open-source in a way everyone can open PRs and contribute, add data via PRs, and so on.</p>
