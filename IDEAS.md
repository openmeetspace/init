# Ideas

This document has the rough ideas and plans put forth to make OpenMeetSpace a reality. The final expected outcome being an "open" network of people in various industries with zero hierarchies with the opportunity to collaborate with each other. 

## Philosophy

Everything OpenMeetSpace do will be "open-source" -- ideas, plans, and the tech used. This is an initiative to make collaborations and networking easy via meetups and online communities.

> **How is it different from XYZ?**
> 
> This is mainly an open web platform to help communities organize meetups, find supporting venues, find target audience, and collaborate mainly revolving around small meetups.

## Outline

OpenMeet.space is going to be an open platform with two main categories:

---

### 1. Meetups

This will be a platform to host and see upcoming meetups and OpenMeet.space will provide connections to venues and the network to reach the intended community.

- **Organize** - Everyone can host meetups and reach their targeted audience.
- **Venue** - We will be aggregating venues that are ready to host and support these events.
- **SwagShop** - For the events support or as goodies, you can distribute and manage swags (t-shirts, stickers, etc.) for the said meetup.

### 2. People

A catalog of people with their interests and a way to contact them. This is for the purpose of networking, it's just going to be a social link tree setup and nothing else.

> **NOTE:** The people who'll be in the catalog will only be added with their personal consent.

### Tech

The platform is going to be a website hosted on [OpenMeet.space](OpenMeet.space), the tech behind it will be completely open-source in a way everyone can open PRs and contribute, add data via PRs, and so on.
